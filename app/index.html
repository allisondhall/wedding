        <h2 class="section-header">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="us-story">We met on a Tuesday; it was the second day of our internship at LinkedIn, and I was running late for our 10:00am meeting. There were only a few seats left so naturally I grabbed the seat next to the cute girl. From there we became fast friends, and both us and our roommates hung out pretty much every night.</p>
        <p class="us-story">After the internship was over, we stayed in touch from across the country, and all of Allison’s friends wondered who this guy was that could capture her attention when all other men had failed. After graduating in December, I took a two month round-the-world trip, stopping first in San Francisco and visiting Allison in Berkeley. Being the charmer that I am, I waited until I had gotten to Sydney to make things official. After Allison graduated, she did her own world tour, starting in Chicago to see her beau, then hopping all over Europe. We kept in touch whenever WiFi was available.</p>
        <p class="us-story">After that, we were both in San Francisco working at LinkedIn, often riding the same shuttle to work at 6am. Since getting big kid jobs we’ve ran 4 half marathons, driven (and flown) across the country, travelled to three different continents, and cooked a bajillion meals together. To be fair, I just cut the stuff, Allison does the real cooking. Thank goodness.</p>
        <p class="us-story"><strong>The Proposal:</strong><br /> This one gets entertaining. In December 2016, we were spending the week in Mammoth Lakes, CA shredding up the slopes (that’s snowboarding, for the laymen and skiers). Actually, lets rewind a bit. The story is way better with context.
        </p>
        <p class="us-story">For those of you that don’t know, I’m not a planner. Fortunately, Allison is, which works out very well for me. Unfortunately though, this means that surprising her with some fancy planned shenanigans is near impossible, because what screams “I’m gonna propose” more than “Hey Allison I suddenly have some specially planned thing for us to do”?</p>
        <p class="us-story">I ordered the ring on Thanksgiving (on the internet, on my phone, can you believe that?). They said the ring wouldn’t make it to the jeweler in time for me to bring it with on our trip to Mammoth, shucks. A few days after getting there, I got the confirmation the ring was ready for pickup, and I decided that this was too good to pass up. I messaged Therese (Maid of Honor), and asked her to pick up the ring and ship it to me. After swearing up and down that I was willing to put the ring through USPS, it was sent. </p>
        <p class="us-story">After receiving the ring (and letting Therese know it was safe), I put a fire in the fireplace, poured some champagne, put on some Christmas music and asked Allison to come out to the balcony to enjoy the snow. One knee yadda yadda we’re engaged.</p>
